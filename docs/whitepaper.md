## 1. Executive Summary
The Heaven Project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem developed on the **Binance Smart Chain (BSC)**.  
The core of the project is a set of self-executing and immutable smart contracts that pursue three primary objectives:

1. Distribution of the native HVN token through an interactive model based on smart contracts.  
2. Implementation of a value storage mechanism in the form of a smart contract.  
3. Establishment of a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) that ultimately transfers control of the ecosystem to the community of token holders.  

This document serves as a reference, detailing the technical foundations, economic mechanisms, governance structure, and roadmap for the developer and user community.  

---

## 2. Introduction and Project Philosophy
The Heaven Project is founded on the belief that real value in blockchain ecosystems is created through an active and vested community.  
The goal is to create a system that automatically and fairly returns a share of the created value directly to its participants.  

### 2.1 Foundational Principles
- Decentralization: No centralized entity controls the contracts or assets.  
- Absolute Transparency: All transactions, fund distributions, and allocations are publicly traceable and verifiable on the Binance blockchain.  
- Fair Distribution: Mechanisms are designed to prevent excessive token concentration (formation of "whales").  
- Community-Driven Governance: Control of the project is gradually transferred to the community via the DAO.  

### 2.2 Overall Architecture
This ecosystem consists of four main smart contracts that operate in coordination:

1. Heaven Token Contract: The native token and unit of value for the network.  
2. Heaven Network Contract: Manages membership, activity registration, and distribution allocations.  
3. Gift Manager Contract: Supports new users and facilitates targeted gift distribution.  
4. Heaven DAO Contract: Securely holds assets and executes community governance.

## 3. Tokenomics (HVN Token Economy)

### 3.1 HVN Token Technical Specifications
- Full Name: Heaven  
- Symbol: HVN  
- Standard: BEP-20  
- Blockchain: Binance Smart Chain (BSC)  
- Maximum Supply: 100,000,000 (One Hundred Million) units  
- Re-mintable: No – fixed supply.  

### 3.2 Initial Supply Allocation
- Strategic Reserve (7%): 7 million tokens for initial liquidity, future collaborations, and holders.  
- Allocation to the Interactive Ecosystem (93%): 93% of the initial HVN token supply is allocated to the Network Contract to be distributed transparently and automatically based on user interaction with the ecosystem's activities and smart contracts. This process is designed as a decentralized distribution mechanism aimed at creating an active and widespread community.  

### 3.3 Asset Allocation Mechanism
The goal is to create a stablecoin (USDT) value reserve fund that indirectly supports the ecosystem's stability.  

**Input sources for this reserve include:**  
- 34% of each user's initial interaction condition (17 USDT out of 50 USDT).  
- 34% from the transfer parameter in the initial phase.  
- 5% from users with extensive interaction activity (over 128 registered interactions in the contract).  
- Other sources such as user status change conditions.  

**Reserve Control:** Assets allocated to this fund are locked in the DAO contract and will only be accessible through the community voting process. Even the initial development team does not have access to these funds.

### 3.4 Transfer Parameters in the Initial Phase
To manage network stability in the initial phase and prevent speculative activities, transferring HVN tokens between wallets is subject to a fixed parameter. This parameter is transferred to the Asset Vault and the DAO contract to support the ecosystem's value. After the initial stages are completed and the DAO is fully activated, the community of token holders can decide on reducing or removing this parameter through the DAO voting process.

## 4. Smart Contract Architecture

### 4.1 Heaven Network Contract
The Heaven Network Contract is responsible for registering user interactions and distributing allocations based on transparent interaction with the ecosystem. It is designed to maintain balance in network interactions and ensure decentralized and fair distribution of HVN tokens.  

- Initial Interaction Condition: 50 USDT (standard interaction) + 100 USDT optional (to advance to the enhanced interaction level).  
- Interaction Structure: Model balancing user activity across two parallel branches.  
- Allocation Mechanism: Based on the level of interaction and activity balance within the network.  
- Maximum Daily Activity-Based Allocation: Standard Interaction Level: Up to 600 USDT | Enhanced Interaction Level: Up to 1,260 USDT.  
- Payout Interval: Every 2 hours (by users calling the reward function).  
- Membership Condition Split: Interactors: 56% | Asset Vault: 34% | Gift Fund: 6% | Development & Maintenance: 4%.  

### 4.2 Gift Manager Contract
Aims to encourage new users and maintain network dynamism.  

**Conditions to receive a 10 USDT gift:**  
- At least 60 days have passed since registration.  
- Having fewer than 5 directly registered users.  
- Not having previously received a gift or interactive allocation.  

**Activator Incentive:** The user who initiates the gift distribution process receives 2 USDT.  

### 4.3 Heaven DAO Contract
- Securely holds the assets of the Asset Vault and other reserves.  
- Enables the definition and execution of Proposals and voting by the HVN token holder community.  
- Has no centralized access for withdrawing its assets.

## 5. Security and Exit Mechanisms

### 5.1 Regulated Exit Protocol
This mechanism provides a transparent exit path and is not a market buyback of tokens.  

**Regulated Exit Steps:**  
1. Time Condition: At least 70 days must have passed since the initial registration date.  
2. Administrative Fee: Payment of 5 USDT as a status change parameter.  
3. Balance Calculation: The user's total received amount from the project (allocations) is subtracted from the initial registration amount (50 USDT).  
4. Final Disbursement: Any positive balance will be deposited into the user's digital wallet within a maximum of 72 hours.  

### 5.2 Network Stability Preservation Algorithms
- Interaction Level Stabilization Fee: Users who reach a defined interaction level in the contract are required to stabilize their position by paying an additional 50 USDT (25 USDT for enhanced-level users) to continue receiving allocations. These funds are returned to the allocation cycle.  
- Flags: Users are "flagged" under specific conditions (e.g., receiving a gift or reaching the call allocation limit) to prevent duplicate receipts.

## 6. Milestone Rewards

### 6.1 Philosophy and Purpose
The Heaven Project believes that healthy network growth results from committed contributors who help create structural balance within the ecosystem.  
The Milestone Reward system is designed as a complementary incentive mechanism to recognize users who contribute to the qualitative and balanced development of the network.  

**Key Difference from Pyramid Models:**  
This system focuses on the quality of participation (network balance, sustained activity), not merely on recruitment quantity. Rewards are paid from the token quota allocated to the ecosystem, and their source is predetermined in the smart contract.  

### 6.2 General Mechanism
Milestone Rewards are distributed based on structural achievements within the network, including qualitative metrics such as:

- Creating balance in the user's network structure.  
- Balanced development of sub-branches.  
- Sustained and qualitative participation in the ecosystem.  

These rewards complement daily activity income and have a defined cumulative cap.  

### 6.3 Transparency and Control
- All Milestone Reward payments are traceable on the blockchain.  
- A maximum cap of 20,000 HVN per user is set.  
- Distribution of these rewards is solely from the tokens allocated to the ecosystem in the smart contract.  
- In the future, the parameters of this system can be revised by the DAO through community governance.  

### 6.4 Distinction from Pyramid Schemes

| Feature        | Heaven Project                          | Pyramid Schemes              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Source of Value| Token with utility in the ecosystem     | Cash from new users          |
| Primary Focus  | Quality and network balance             | Quantity and recruitment only|
| Income Cap     | Yes                                     | No                           |
| Dependency     | On multiple qualitative metrics         | Only on new recruitment      |

**Important Note:** This aspect of the project does not guarantee income in any way, and participation is only possible by accepting the inherent risks of blockchain.
